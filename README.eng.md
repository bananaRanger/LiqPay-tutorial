# LiqPay iOS integration tutorial

## Introduction

There are a lot of applications and sites with online-payments in our time of online-shops and online-services.
The operation that makes the user's life easier also can force programmers to drink more tea. 
It's clear with America and Europe. They usually use Stripe and PayPal. There is local service - [LiqPay](https://www.liqpay.ua) for sending and receiving payments in Ukraine.
[Fondy](https://www.fondy.ua) is used too.

But I want to focus on LiqPay.

> LiqPay is an online payment settlement system. 
> It allows receiving and sending payments with the mobile phone, 
> internet and payment cards all over the world.
>
> LiqPay was created in 2008 by the PrivatBank command. 
> It's a Webmoney and PayPal alternative.

You can meet LiqPay very often in applications or sites where you should make a payment. But a few time I was witnessed that the iOS library caused some questions and difficulties while the programmer used it.
That's why I considered creating this tutorial.

## Start

First of all, you need to look through the developer's [documentation](https://www.liqpay.ua/documentation/).

And download `.lib` and `.a` files from official [repo](https://github.com/liqpay/sdk-ios).
